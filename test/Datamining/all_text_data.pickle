aVBitcoin is an innovative payment network and a new kind of money.
p5
aVBitcoin uses peer-to-peer technology to operate with no central authority or banks; managing transactions and the issuing of bitcoins is carried out collectively by the network. Bitcoin is open-source; its design is public, nobody owns or controls Bitcoin and everyone can take part. Through many of its unique properties, Bitcoin allows exciting uses that could not be covered by any previous payment system.

aVEthereum is a  decentralized platform that runs smart contracts: applications that run exactly as programmed without any possibility of downtime, censorship, fraud or third party interference.
p4
aVThese apps run on a custom built  blockchain, an enormously powerful shared global infrastructure that can move value around and represent the ownership of property. This enables developers to create markets, store registries of debts or promises, move funds in accordance with instructions given long in the past (like a will or a futures contract) and many other things that have not been invented yet, all without a middle man or counterparty risk.
p5
aVThe project was bootstrapped via an ether pre-sale during August 2014 by fans all around the world. It is developed by the  Ethereum Foundation, a Swiss nonprofit, with contributions from great minds across the globe.
p6
aVThe  Ethereum Wallet  is a gateway to decentralized applications on the Ethereum blockchain. It allows you to hold and secure ether and other crypto-assets built on Ethereum, as well as write, deploy and use smart contracts.
p7
aVCreate a tradeable digital token that can be used as a currency, a representation of an asset, a virtual share, a proof of membership or anything at all. These tokens use a standard coin API, so your contract will be automatically compatible with any wallet, other contract or exchange also using this standard.
p8
aVThe total amount of tokens in circulation can be set to a simple fixed amount or fluctuate based on any programmed ruleset.
p9
aVDo you already have ideas that you want to develop on Ethereum? Maybe you need help and some funds to bring them to life, but who would lend money to someone they don\u2019t trust?
p10
aVUsing Ethereum, you can create a contract that will hold a contributor's money until any given date or goal is reached. Depending on the outcome, the funds will either be released to the project owners or safely returned back to the contributors. All of this is possible without requiring a centralized arbitrator, clearing house or having to trust anyone.
p11
aVYou can even use the token you created earlier to keep track of the distribution of rewards.
p12
aVNow that you have developed your idea and secured funds, what\u2019s next? You have to hire managers, find a trustworthy CFO to handle the accounts, run board meetings and do a bunch of paperwork.
p13
aVOr you can simply leave all that to an Ethereum contract. It will collect proposals from your backers and submit them through a completely transparent voting process.
p14
aVOne of the many advantages of having a robot run your organization is that it is immune to any outside influence as it\u2019s guaranteed to execute only what it was programmed to. And because the Ethereum network is decentralized, you'll be able to provide services with a 100% uptime guarantee.
p15
aVNow it's your turn: start building what you dream of creating in Ethereum! Could your business be enhanced by operating on a cryptographically secure, decentralized, tamper-proof network?
p16
aVCheck out the many great projects* already being built on Ethereum. And since you'll be among the first developers in the world that are able to program decentralized applications, some of them might need your help.

VEthereum Classic (ETC)
p2
(lp3
VEthereum Classic is a decentralized platform that runs smart contracts: applications that run exactly as programmed without any possibility of downtime, censorship, fraud or third party interference.
p4
aVEthereum Classic is a continuation of the original Ethereum blockchain - the classic version preserving untampered history; free from external interference and subjective tampering of transactions.
p5
aVWe believe the core value proposition of any blockchain is immutability; valid transactions can never be erased or forgotten. Individuals interacting on Ethereum Classic are governed by this reality; Code is Law.
p6
aVThis does not necessarily mean that code replaces existing laws, or that only code is law (there are many geographical jurisdictions), but it gives users the opportunity to enter into a new blockchain-based jurisdiction where agreements are governed by code.
p7
aVBy entering into contracts on Ethereum Classic, you can be certain that the network remains neutral. The outcome of transactions will be dictated by code you voluntarily interact with. Unless explicitly defined by the contract code, there are no reversals, no undos, no opt-outs.
p8
aVTransactions are final; applications are unstoppable.
p9
aVThere are many problems that fester due to centralization and opaqueness; corruption, unaccountability, nepotism, inefficiency and stagnation. Ultimately, centralization leads to fragility; only decentralized systems can stand the test of time.
p10
aVThese problems can be only solved by adhering to governance systems that do not rely on a central point of failure. Just like distributed networks and the consensus protocol itself, we believe that only truly decentralized projects can survive in the long run.
p11
aVEthereum Classic manifests these values by relinquishing control by a formalized central foundation. The only hierarchy is that of transparent meritocracy and mutual reputation. No backroom deals or behind-closed-doors unilateral decision making; just free and open discourse.

aVThe Ethereum Foundation releases a 'Soft Fork' client to censor transactions coming from the hacker; mining pools vote to enable it by lowering gas limit
p25
aVCritical Denial of Service flaws are found in the Soft Fork implementation, miners quicky decide not to use it
p26
aVMany days of intense arguing goes on in the Ethereum community about the pros and cons of implementing a Hard Fork
p27
aVThe only remaining option is a controversial Hard Fork. A Specification is determined and announced by Slock.it and Ethereum Foundation members
p28
aVWith 12 hours notice, The Ethereum Foundation use a controversial third party 'coin vote' to determine that the Hard Fork should be turned on by default; consensus is declared and an updated client is released
p29
aVWith around 80% of nodes updating to the new client, the community nervously await the arrival of the Hard Fork activation block 1920000
p30
aVThe community lets out a sigh of relief as the Hard Fork code is succesfully implemented with no obvious flaws; champagne corks are popped all over the globe
p31
aVWith predictions of the original non-forked chain to disappear within hours, many are surprised to find that miners continue mining blocks and OTC trading of the original chain tokens gives them value

p34
aVThe Ethereum Classic community begins to branch off from the forked-chain subreddits and form its own communication channels, including /r/EthereumClassic, Slack and Telegram

p47
aVEveryone who had ether tokens prior to DAO bailout fork now has an equal amount of classic ethers (ETC) on the same address.
p48
aVBlockchain technology exists to serve the people, and this can only be achieved fairly and effectively if the the network is neutral to which transactions get processed. In the long run, only applications that run this way will be truly trustless, and we need the help of everyday users to grow the network and create demand for useful ETC dApps.
p49
aVProgression of technology is the fundamental motivating factor of developer adoption. Ethereum Classic represents another chance to continue the development of the original, world-changing, decentralized, Turing-complete smart contract platform.
p50
aVFrom newbies to professionals, whether you\u2019re a protocol, dApp, web or native developer, the Ethereum Classic community always welcomes your help implementing the original Ethereum vision.
p51
aVEmergence of Ethereum Classic created a huge opportunity for miners. ETC is presently one of the most profitable tokens to mine and is attracting substantial hash power with zero switching cost.
p52
aVAs a miner, it\u2019s in your best interests to support ETC. Ethereum Foundation is going to \u201cfire\u201d all Ethereum miners by switching to experimental PoS model. Ethereum Classic is going to maintain time-proven PoW consensus, rewarding GPU miners supporting the original Ethereum chain. Do it for profit and principles; mine Ethereum Classic today!
p53
aVPeople who understand the core value proposition of open, neutral, immutable blockchains have an opportunity to invest in the growth of the original Ethereum vision by buying classic ether tokens (ETC).
p54

VGolem (GNT)
p2
(lp3
VGolem is a global, open sourced, decentralized supercomputer that anyone can access. It's made up of the combined power of user's machines, from personal laptops to entire datacenters.
p4
aVAnyone will be able to use Golem to compute (almost) any program you can think of, from rendering to research to running websites, in a completely decentralized & inexpensive way.
p5
aVThe Golem Network is a decentralized sharing economy of computing power, where anyone can make money 'renting' out their computing power or developing & selling software.
p6
aVCOMPUTER GRAPHICS\u000aGolem can distribute the task of rendering CGI, doing in minutes what would take days, for cheaper than anything else.\u000aThe first version, Brass Golem, will do this only.
p7
aVBUSINESS\u000aFrom stock market predictions to big data analysis, Golem can speed up business computation while lowering costs.
p8
aVMACHINE LEARNING\u000aWhether you're teaching an AI to beat grandmasters or recognize images or human voice patterns, you can go to Golem to speed up the process
p9
aVCRYPTOGRAPHY\u000aGolem can run the world's first and largest fully decentralized cryptocurrency mining pools. It can also help with cryptography work like integer factorization.
p10
aVSCIENCE\u000aThe world of science can benefit immensely from inexpensive and easy access to a powerful supercomputer. From DNA analysis to protein folding simulations to searching for alien life and on and on.
p11
aVMICROSERVICES\u000aThe Golem application registry can run countless types of decentralized microservices and dapps, which anyone will be able to develop and share (for a profit, if they wish).\u000aThese are just the tip of the iceberg in Golem's potential use cases. And more will appear as more technologies come to fruition.
p12
aVGolem enables users/applications (requestors) to rent out cycles of other users\u2019 (providers) machines. Any user ranging from a single PC owner to a large data center can contribute resources to Golem network.
p13
aVSoftware developers are in the center of Golem\u2019s ecosystem: Application Registry and Transaction Framework enable anyone to deploy and distribute applications in the Golem network.
p14
aVAn Ethereum-based transaction system clears payments between providers, requestors and software developers.
p15
aVDECENTRALIZED AND SCALABLE\u000aThere is no single point of failure and no trusted authority, even though Golem is capable of connecting millions of nodes using a P2P architecture
p16
aVSECURE\u000aAll computations take place in virtual machines and are fully isolated from the host\u2019s system
p17
aVALWAYS OPEN FOR INNOVATIVE INTEGRATIONS\u000aDevelopers can deploy their own integration on Golem and implement an appropriate monetization mechanism.
p18
aVP2P NETWORK\u000aPeer-to-peer architecture guarantees decentralization and scalability. Golem supports peer discovery and communication with a specific node. Every connection is encrypted and signed to guarantee security and authentication.
p19
aVTRANSACTION SYSTEM\u000aGolem includes a multi-agent transaction system for matching users requesting computing power with its providers.
p20
aVTASK DEFINITION\u000aUsers define computing tasks easily using Golem's Task Definition Framework and libraries for high-level programming languages. Golem then automatically distributes each task over the network to computing nodes.
p21
aVTASK COMPUTATION\u000aComputations in Golem nodes take place inside isolated virtual machines, for maximum security. Providers are able to decide how many CPU cores, and how much RAM and disk space they wish to rent to the Golem Network.
p22
aVREPUTATION SYSTEM\u000aA reputation system enforces desired behavior of nodes in a decentralized environment, without relying on any supervising institution. This allows nodes to attribute a reputation rank to their peers. A node's rank is lowered in case of inappropriate behavior and is increased after successful computation.
p23
aVAPPLICATION REGISTRY & TRANSACTION FRAMEWORK\u000aDevelopers can create and distribute software on the Golem Network's Application Registry (kind of like an app store), and use the Transaction Framework to choose whatever remuneration model they desire to make a profit (or not) from their software.

VAugur combines the magic of prediction markets with the power of a decentralized network to create a stunningly accurate forecasting tool - and the chance for real money trading profits
p4
aVWe won't share your email address or send you any spam - we promise!
p5
aVAugur is a prediction market platform that rewards you for correctly predicting future real-world events.
p6
aVYou make your predictions by trading virtual shares in the outcome of events happening in the real-world. If you think Hillary Clinton will be elected President, the Yankees will win the World Series, or Leonardo DiCaprio will win another Oscar, then you'll buy shares in those outcomes. If you buy shares in the correct outcomes, you'll win real money profits.
p7
aVThe prices of the shares you trade in any event adds up to one dollar - so if you buy a share at even odds it will cost you 50 cents. If you end up being right, you'll get back one dollar for every share you bought. If you're wrong then you've lost the money used to buy your shares. As with any market, the price of shares fluctuates over time. As more people buy shares in an outcome, the price of that outcome will rise while the price of other outcomes will fall. This gives you further opportunities for profit - by buying low and selling high, before the final result of the market is known.
p8
aVAugur's prediction markets provide powerful predictive data - you can think of the current market price of any share in any market as an estimate of the probability of that outcome actually occurring in the real world. For example, a share priced at 64 cents has a 64% probability of happening.
p9
aVThe accuracy of prediction markets rests in the idea of the "The Wisdom of the Crowd". This states that the average prediction made by a group is superior to that made by any of the individuals in that group. Markets are the perfect way to aggregate this collective wisdom - which is made up of all the information, analysis and opinion held by members of the group. With these individuals buying and selling shares in the outcome of real-world events, based on their personal knowledge and opinion, the market prices reach an equilibrium that reflect the opinion of the entire group.
p10
aVPrediction markets have proven to be more accurate at forecasting the future than individual experts, surveys or traditional opinion polling. They provide real-time predictive data and are traded using real money - which incentivises market participants to reveal what they think will happen, rather than what they hope will happen. Traders are putting their money where their mouths are.
p11
aVExisting on a decentralized network gives Augur a unique edge over other prediction markets.
p12
aVAugur is a decentralized platform built on the Ethereum blockchain - which means no central servers that can be switched off.
p13
aVUsing Augur, anyone, anywhere in the world can quickly and easily create a prediction market asking a question about anything. As a market creator you'll provide some initial funding for the market and in return receive half of all trading fees collected during the lifetime of that market.
p14
aVAugur's fees are set by users, and are vastly lower compared to traditional trading and betting platforms.
p15
aVIn centralized markets, one person determines the final market outcomes - which means there can be mistakes or outright manipulation. With Augur, we'll have thousands reporting on market outcomes using a one-of-a kind consensus based system and a unique token called REPutation. As a reporter, you'll report on events every two months and, in return, receive half of all fees in the system multiplied by the percent of REP you own. The full scoop on REP
p16
aVAll funds are stored in smart contracts - eliminating counterparty risk and allowing fast, automated payments to winning traders. Depositing and withdrawing funds are also completely automated using the blockchain. With no human intervention required, there's no human error.
p17
aVAfter months of development we are pleased to release the beta version of Augur. This early version showcases the core features of our prediction market platform. We're still actively developing the software and working on design, but we'd love to hear your honest and unfiltered feedback about our work so far.
p18
aVNo cost and no deposit required - it's all just play money during beta testing.

aVBasic Attention Token radically improves the efficiency of digital advertising by creating a new token that can be exchanged between publishers, advertisers and users. It all happens on the Ethereum blockchain. 
p6
aVThe token can be used to obtain a variety of advertising and attention-based services on the Brave platform. The utility of the token is based on user attention, which simply means a person\u2019s focused mental engagement.  
p7
aVThe Challenge
p8

p10

p11
aVAdvertisers are losing.
p12
aVBlockchain Digital Advertising.
p13
aVIntroducing a decentralized, transparent digital ad exchange based on Ethereum Blockchain.
p14
aVStage 1: Brave Browser
p15
aVBrave is a fast, open source, privacy-focused browser that blocks malvertisements, trackers, and contains a ledger system that anonymously captures user attention to accurately reward publishers.
p16
aVStage 2: Basic Attention Token
p17
aVThe Basic Attention Token can be used to obtain a variety of advertising and attention-based services on the Brave platform, as it is exchanged between publishers, advertisers and users.
p18
aVThe token\u2019s utility is derived from \u2014 or denominated by \u2014 user attention.
p19
aVAttention is really just focused mental engagement \u2014 on an advertisement, in this case.
p20
aVStages 1 + 2 = A New Deal
p21
aVThe Brave browser knows where users spend their time, making it the perfect tool to calculate and reward publishers with BATs. This service creates a transparent and efficient Blockchain-based digital advertising market. Publishers receive more revenue because middlemen and fraud are reduced. Users, who opt in, receive fewer but better targeted ads that are less prone to malware. And advertisers get better data on their spending.
p22
aVHow It Works
p23
aVThe Brave browser anonymously monitors user attention, then rewards publishers accordingly with BATs. 
p24
aVMeasuring Attention
p25
aVAttention is measured as viewed for content and ads only in the browser\u2019s active tab in real time. The Attention Value for the ad will be calculated based on incremental duration and pixels in view in proportion to relevant content, prior to any direct engagement with the ad. We will define further anonymous cost-per-action models as the system develops. 
p26
aVAds are then anonymously matched with customer interests using local machine learning algorithms. This means less irrelevant ads. 
p27
aVBrave will work with publishers and advertisers to establish best practices for judging user attention. One potential metric: the number of total views of advertising content for a certain number of seconds. Or, points assigned on the length of a view.
p28
aVWho Gets What?
p29
aVUsers viewing ads will be rewarded with BATs. BATs can be used for premium content or services on the Brave platform.
p30
aVPublishers will, as part of this service, receive the lion\u2019s share of the total ad revenue spend. We anticipate the users will also donate back some tokens to the publishers, increasing their revenue.

aVGet involved with SAFE Network discussions in the community run forum.
p5
aVThe SAFE Network is soon to provide access to a world of exciting apps where the security of your data is put above all else. In time, downloading the free SAFE software will provide access to: messaging, apps, email, social networks, data storage, video conferencing, and much more.
p6
aVRather than using data centres and servers common within today\u2019s internet, which are prone to data theft and surveillance, the SAFE Network uses advanced P2P technology, that joins together the spare computing capacity of all SAFE users, creating a global network. You can think of SAFE as a crowd sourced internet. It is on this network that everyone\u2019s data and applications reside.
p7
aVAll you need to join this network is to download the free SAFE software, create your account and tell the network how much space you are going to provide. It\u2019s that simple!
p8
aVBy providing your unused computing resources to SAFE you will be paid in a network token, called safecoin. To start earning, download the free SAFE software, create your account and tell the network how much space you are going to provide.
p9
aVAs network data is stored and retrieved from your computer (Vault), your virtual wallet will start to automatically receive safecoin. You can use these to pay for other services on the network, or convert to another currency via a SAFE currency exchange.
p10
aVThe ecosystem around the SAFE Network is already starting to blossom and a number of exciting apps* are already being built by third party developers using the SAFE APIs.
p11
aVApplications that provide access via the Launcher API ensure that you can access all apps with the same PIN, username and password used when you created your SAFE account. This means that you stay in control of your details at all times.

aVEvery asset represents a unique bullion bar sitting in designated securitised custodial vaults. The provenance of the Gold is traceable, immutable and exists indefinitely.
p5
aV
aVDigix is an asset-tokenisation platform built on Ethereum. We leverage the blockchain's immutability, transparency and auditability by applying it to precious physical assets.
p6
aVDigix has created a range of technologies including The Proof of Asset Protocol (POA), Digix Gold Tokens (DGX), a gold-backed token for Ethereum, and DGD - Digix DAO Tokens.
p7
aVOtherwise known as Distributed Ledger Technologies, it relies on participating users to power the network by confirming transactions while utilising a general consensus mechanism. The \u2018blocks\u2019 of information are stored chronologically on every computer - in a decentralized fashion.
p8
aVDigix has developed a system of proving asset existence and ownership on the blockchain.\u000aEvery step of the way, records of proof are published permanently using Ethereum and IPFS.

p17
aVShop by chatting with a merchant's bot, pay in two clicks. Exchanges and other services are also easy to use in conversational interface.
p18
aVWhen you want complete privacy, pay in blackbytes, a cash-like untraceable currency whose transactions are not visible on the public database, they are sent peer-to-peer instead.
p19
aVThere is no central entity that stores and processes all the payments. Instead, transactions created by users are cryptographically linked to each other, and once you add your new transaction, the number of other transactions that link to it grows like snowball.
p20
aVOnce stored in the Byteball database, the data can neither be revised nor removed.
p21
aVAfter certain criteria are met, a new transaction becomes final. It cannot be revised even by a powerful attacker.
p22
aVRegulated institutions can issue assets that are compatible with KYC/AML requirements. Every transfer of such asset is to be cosigned by the issuer, and if there is anything that contradicts the regulations, the issuer won't cosign.
p23
aVFor security, you can require that your funds be spendable only when several signatures are provided, e.g. from your laptop and from your phone. For shared control of funds, signatures from different people may be required.
p24
aVWhen dealing with untrusted counterparties, you can lock the funds on an address that is spendable either by you or by the counterparty, depending on the events registered to the database by trusted third parties.
p25
aVWhen two parties sign a single unit that executes both legs of the exchange, the two transactions either happen simultaneously or don't happen at all. It is no longer necessary to trust any centralized exchanges.
p26
aVAfter installing, chat with the Transition Bot to participate in the next distribution round\u000aBuy or sell bytes by chatting with a trading bot\u000aP2P exchange bytes vs bitcoins, get your merkle proof by chatting with BTC Oracle\u000aView public transactions on the DAG explorer
p27
aV98% of all bytes and blackbytes will be distributed to current Bitcoin holders who bother to prove their Bitcoin balances during at least one of distribution rounds. No investment is required, you need just to link your Bitcoin and Byteball addresses by making a small BTC payment or by signing a message with your Bitcoin address. Then the number of bytes and blackbytes you receive in each round will be proportional to the balance of your Bitcoin address in the snapshot block of that round.
p28
aVIn the first round, over 70,000 BTC was linked, and we distributed 10% of all bytes and blackbytes according to linked Bitcoin balances in the first Bitcoin block timestamped Dec 25, 2016 (Christmas block). In the 2nd to 5th rounds, we distributed another 9%, over 200,000 BTC was linked.
p29
aVIn the 6th round, which is scheduled for the full moon of June (June 9, 2017 at 13:10 UTC), we'll distribute 62.5 MB for each 1 BTC of linked balance and 0.2 new byte for each 1 byte you already hold. To participate, install the wallet and chat with the Transition Bot that will help you link your Bitcoin and Byteball addresses. Track linking progress at transition.byteball.org.
p30
aVByteball data is stored and ordered using directed acyclic graph (DAG) rather than blockchain. This allows all users to secure each other's data by referencing earlier data units created by other users, and also removes scalability limits common for blockchains, such as blocksize issue.
p31
aVThe consensus algorithm used to protect from double-spends is based on establishing a total order within the DAG. This is achieved by selecting a chain, called main chain, which gravitates towards units issued by commonly recognized reputable users \u2014 witnesses. See the white paper for details.
p32
aVTestnet wallet is also available if you are a developer or want to experience the features of Byteball without spending a penny.
p33
aVJoin Byteball on Slack! There are many channels with lively discussions about future developments, trading, auctions, to name just a few. If you have any issues with the Byteball wallet, our competent support staff will take care of it at the #helpdesk channel. Please get your invite here: slack.byteball.org.
p34
aVYou can buy or sell bytes without leaving the wallet by chatting with a trading bot. You can also trade on Bittrex, Cryptox, Cryptopia, Changelly, and Bitsquare exchanges.

(lp3
VThe Ardor Main Chain will be where all Ardor tokens (ARDR) will reside. It will serve as the system that secures all child chains and processes their transactions. While some transactions will be possible on the Main Chain, such as exchanging ARDR from one account to the other, most features will be unavailable on the chain itself in order to improve its performance and reduce blockchain bloat. Because it is 100% Proof-of-Stake, no additional processing will be needed for mining as no new tokens will be created.
p4
aV
aVThe Ardor testnet is open to everyone. The main purpose of this is to allow users to test the various features of Ardor so that the developers can fine-tune the blockchain platform for the mainnet launch in the third quarter of this year. When using the Ardor testnet, please remember not to use your Nxt passphrase for security reasons. Note: If you have ARDR tokens, do NOT send them to the address you create on the Ardor Testnet. Please send them to a Nxt Wallet from Nxt.org as ARDR is currently an asset on the Nxt blockchain until its launch in Q3.

aVKomodo is secure and private money with a built-in gateway to 32 independent Komodo participating currencies.
p7
aVOur platform will provide smart contracts and blockchain based solutions for the cryptocurrency industry.
p8
aVWith Komodo you can choose between transparent and anonymous transactions. A technology called zk-SNARKs hides the sender, receiver, and transaction amount.
p9
aVKomodo has Bitcoin level security. Through our new consensus mechanism all Komodo transactions will be backed by Bitcoin\u2019s hashrate after each new Bitcoin block is found.
p10
aVKomodo is the gateway to 32 stable Komodo Currencies. Each participating currency has its own independent blockchain and is pegged to a local fiat currency.
p11
aVAn advanced wallet with built-in multi-coin support, decentralized exchange, and cryptocurrency anonymizer.
p12
aVIt\u2019s still in early beta. For daily KMD transactions we recommend the Komodo Swing Wallet.
p13
aVA normal Komodo Wallet. Contains no advanced tech, and is thus currently more reliable than the Agama Wallet.
p14
aVRecommended for use before Agama Wallet matures. Remember to backup your wallet.dat file.
p15
aV
aVAnonymous transactions will be encrypted on the blockchain with zero knowledge proofs. No one can find out who sent a transaction, the value of the transaction, or to whom it was sent. The transaction metadata is encrypted and zero-knowledge proof construction, called a zk-SNARK, is used to prove that no double-spending is taking place.
p16
aVKomodo blockchain achieves Bitcoin level security through an innovation called \u2018delayed Proof of Work\u2019 (dPoW). Komodo Platform notarizes its blockhashes into the Bitcoin blockchain. In addition, Komodo Platform can provide the same security layer to any other third-party blockchain. In that case, the notarizations are done to the Komodo blockchain.
p17
aVKomodo coins can be converted into 32 different Komodo Currencies. These currencies are pegged to local fiat currencies, and thus maintain a stable value. Each currency has its own blockchain, and in that respect behaves just like any other cryptocurrency. The Komodo Currencies are easy to integrate into the existing blockchain infrastructure, and they offer a stepping stone into the world of cryptocurrency.

aVThe Bancor protocol enables built-in price discovery and a liquidity mechanism for tokens on smart contract blockchains. These \u201csmart tokens\u201d hold one or more other tokens in reserve and enable any party to instantly purchase or liquidate the smart token in exchange for any of its reserve tokens, directly through the smart token\u2019s contract, at a continuously calculated price, according to a formula which balances buy and sell volumes.

aVThe BANCOR network token will hold a single reserve in Ether. Other smart tokens, by using BANCOR as (one of) their reserve(s), connect to the BANCOR network.

aVCryptocurrency mining
p7
aVCryptocurrency mining is called so because it resembles the mining of other commodities i.e. it requires exertion and it slowly makes new currency available at a rate that resembles the rate at which commodities like gold are mined from the ground.
p8
aVWe are investing in Cryptocurrency Mining is the process of adding transaction records to a cryptocurrency\u2019s public ledger of past transactions. This ledger of past transactions is called the Blockchain as it is a chain of blocks. The block chain serves to confirm transactions to the rest of the network as having taken place.
p9
aVNodes use the Blockchain to distinguish legitimate cryptocurrency transactions from attempts to re-spend coins that have already been spent elsewhere.
p10
aVMining is intentionally designed to be resource-intensive and difficult so that the number of blocks found each day by miners remains steady. Individual blocks must contain a proof of work to be considered valid. This proof of work is verified by other cryptocurrency nodes each time they receive a block. Bitcoin uses the hashcash proof-of-work function.
p11
aVThe primary purpose of mining is to allow cryptocurrency nodes to reach a secure, tamper-resistant consensus. Mining is also the mechanism used to introduce cryptocurrency into the system: Miners are paid any transaction fees as well as a "subsidy" of newly created coins. This both serves the purpose of disseminating new coins in a decentralized manner as well as motivating people to provide security for the system.
p12
aVMining funding because it is the most constant way of maintaining the wealth creation as mining directly stimulates growth fund. It is a continuous generation of wealth just like digging gold or minerals beneath the surface of earth. The growth rate of the mining fund is very stable and does not fluctuate much. It is a tangible resource and can be calculated by analyzing its performance.
p13
aVICO:
p14
aVICO stands for Initial Coin Offerings. It is the cryptocurrency version of crowdfunding and are a part of the crypto world that is most likely here to stay. It's one of the easiest and most efficient methods for companies and individuals to fund their projects and for regular users to invest in projects they see value in. An Initial Coin Offering is an event that usually extends over a period of one week or more and in which everyone is allowed to purchase tokens in exchange for established cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) or Ether (ETH).
p15
aVIn an ICO, there can be a specific goal or limit for project funding meaning every token will have a pre-defined price that will not change during the Initial Coin Offering period. This also means that the token supply is static. It is also possible to have a static supply with a dynamic funding goal, in which the distribution of tokens will be made according to the funds received, meaning that the more funds the project receives the higher the token price will be.

The Internet Hardening Fund is managed by NLnet and funded by the Netherlands Ministry of Economic Affairs. The funding will be used to fund 4 Namecoin developers (Jeremy Rand, Hugo Landau, Brandon Roberts, and Joseph Bisch) to produce a usable decentralized TLS public key infrastructure.

aVhow it works
p14
aVA cryptocurrency that uses the unique algorithm called Proof of Capacity (POC), which utilizes your unused hard disk drive space instead of your processor or graphics card to mine BURST. Miners pre-generate individual chunks of data known as 'plots' which are then saved to disk. This individual data just proofs your capacity and is never sent to anyone else. Traffic requirements for mining are therefore extremely low.

aVProof of Capacity is Energy Efficient and Green
p22
aVThe energy consuming part of mining is performing the calculations, but with Burst, the computer performs the calculations once, then all it does while mining is to read a few megabytes off of a hard drive every few minutes and checks every nonce it pulls off, instead of working through heavy calculations like Bitcoin.
p23
aVBurstcoin's transaction network only uses 10 kW compared with Bitcoin's 200 MW. Transaction costs therefore are 0.02 Cents for Burst and 5 Cents for Bitcoin (May 2016). The capital costs for the Burstcoin network are comparable high as for Bitcoin but the operational costs are minimal. So there is a lot of HDD capacity at stake backing the network but always reusable for other individual needs if necessary.

aVProof of Capacity is ASIC Proof
p26
aVOne of the reasons that Litecoin gained fame was because it was believed to be ASIC Proof. Time showed us that Litecoin can be mined by costly and rare ASICs nevertheless. This is unfair for the average small miner and is against the decentralized approach of cryptocurrencies.
p27
aVBurstcoin's Proof of Capacity is based off of Proof of Work, so theoretically you could compute the Proofs in real time. However, it is not possible to require enough work to be done during a 4 minute time frame that even the most cost efficient ASIC cannot mine efficiently enough to make it cheaper to use than a hard drive. ASICs calculation speeds are rising, but so do HDD sizes.

aVMatchpool is a decentralized matchmaking protocol which uses group dynamics to help participants match with each other. It can also be used as a more generic platform for any kind of paid membership community which can clearly define two sides of an interaction or market. This paper presents the elements of the platform: the Ethereum smart contracts which handle the trust-sensitive ownership and reward structures, as well as the core game logic which makes it work. Finally we lay out a two year roadmap for launching and scaling the network, including a detailed specification of the Guppy token (GUP), which will play an integral role in its development.

aVWe are one of the most developed and feature rich digital currencies. We focus on long term innovation. The world has just been introduced to digital currencies and many still do not know about Bitcoin, which has had a lot of media attention. Just think of digital currency like an internet connection in 1992. Most people knew about the internet and only a few used it with a 56k modem. Large adoption came a few years later. The technology was there and evolved quickly just like the state of digital currency today. Digital currency is just like that. Once people begin to realize and understand what a big advancement digital currency is, allowing people to pay for goods and services easily and quickly, with much less fees for merchants, mass adoption will soon follow. Our Team is prepared for that. I/OCoin digital currency is developing a digital coin that will make an ideal payment system, with a strong blockchain technology to future proof our development.
p6
aVI/OCoin has been at the front of pushing the boundaries of what can be achieved with a digital currency. We have introduced IONS (soon to be upgraded) which is a fantastic feature that allows you to send and receive payments by simply using a pre-registered username, E.g. Johndoe.io, making it very easy for anyone, anywhere to send and receive I/OCoins. Not only that, but we are the first to develop a true stand alone, HTML5 desktop wallet. This was a great challenge to the team, but once again goes to show the dedication and talents we have. Many alt coins tried to make a HTML5 wallet and all had failed, this includes coins such as Litecoin, Dogecoin and Peercoin.
p7
aVOur new HTML5 Wallet features a super user friendly, secure and slick interface, that departs from the old bitcoin qt wallet. The I/O Coin team packed eye catching wallet skins that are easily interchangeable adding 3 different color schemes. The wallets feature AES-256-CBC to encrypt the private keys that are held in a wallet. With a slick interface, fast transitions and integrated IONS section, making it easy to send I/O Coins to friends and family using our aliases to send to username. In the future our wallet will expand to support new technologies in crypto.
p8
aVMobile wallet that allows you to send i/o digital currency and receive by simply using a registered IONS user name! No longer do people have to worry about remembering long wallet addresses. All you need to know is the user name of the person you wish to send the coins to and not only that, if you are unsure of the name, you can easily open the IONS address book and quickly find the name and send the number of coins. It really is that easy. Our wallet also features a Point of Sale mode. You can now easily create invoices and has the ability to share via app, email, bluetooth or text message. Auto conversion between currencies and a barcode scanner, are also new added features for easy pay at any I/O Coin accepting Merchant.

aVI/O Coin has been at the front of pushing the boundaries of what can be achieved with a digital currency. We are proud of that. To ensure you always have access to the latest news or development updates, we have a news section. We place updates, announcements and whitepapers here.
p10
aVWe have released our DIONS inforgraphic explaining in overview what can be achieved by our Blockchain ecosystem. Check it out on our foundation website Go to iodigital.io
p11
aVDecentralized key-value storage can be used in various ways. One of those ways is the aliases, (Decentralized implementation of IONS) as enshrined in Blockchain matching aliases to-> addresses. An improvement of this solution will be the addition of an extra message field to all transactions, as well as the expansion of aliases on Private-Addresses. This will allow store/exchange/application. To put this into a real life perspective, it would mean that you will be able to use the brand name, track purchases from different buyers, and at the same keep their balances private. Download the whitepaper.
p12
aVFor I/O Coin there are different official wallets available for different platforms. You should only download wallets from this website. The QT wallet is the basic wallet of I/O Coin. Don't use the QT and HTML5 wallet on one machine. The QT wallets will be discontinued and not developed any further. All future developments will be done on the HTML 5 wallet.\u000a\u000aBootstrap\u000aAn (official) bootstrap.dat is available to fast track the blockchain sync - up to block 734407. You need to manually download it, unzip it and place the bootstrap.dat in the ~/Library/Application Support/iocoin (for OSX) folder and then run the wallet. The bootstrap.dat also works for Windows wallets. Windows users have to copy the bootstrap.dat file into the c\u005cusers\u005cyourusername\u005cAppData\u005cRoaming\u005cIOCoin folder and run the Win client again. Loading the bootstrap into the wallet could take 24 hours but is a much faster way in syncing the wallet for the first time. Download from our GitHub account here (zip).

VExpanse.Tech\u2122 was created as the first stable fork of Ethereum by one of the earliest blockchain developers and cryptocurrency entrepreneurs out there, Christopher Franko. Co-founder James Clayton is also the founder of the Cryptocurrency Collectors Club, (CCC), which is the largest and most popular Cryptocurrency group on Facebook. Dan Conway, another blockchain expert with extensive experience, soon joined the team as the third founder, bringing a great deal of talent, balance, and expertise to the project.
p4
aVExpanse was built as a community-based project without an ICO, (Initial Coin Offering), and is blockchain agnostic. The idea is to use cutting-edge blockchain technology to build anything the community and team can imagine\u2014using a Decentralized Autonomous Organization, (DAO), with a self-funded design to keep it truly decentralized. This way, the Expanse community can evolve and grow while rewarding holders, partners, and investors.
p5
aVThe Expanse platform now has a two-year history of consistent growth and stability. Starting out small, but with big ideas, the team is growing and other projects are now coming on board to help make the dream a reality\u2014limited only by the imagination and talent of all the diverse people around the world involved in the journey. Each new community member and partner brings new ideas and visions for the future. Expanse.Tech plans to be one of the top blockchain projects in the world. Won\u2019t you join us on this adventure? Start learning more about Expanse today!
p6
aVThe Expanse Bond System, (EBS), is an innovative method to reward buying and holding Expanse tokens for a pre-defined period of time. Unlike traditional currency-based bond systems, EBS uses only native EXP to reward those who participate. Functioning similar to a self-funded, secured token savings account, it uses smart contract-based simulated staking on the blockchain with decentralized open source parameters.

VThe Ethereum smart contract-based Casino offers a 0% house edge and solves the casino transparency question once and for all.
p4
aVThe online gambling industry was valued at USD $45 billion in 2016. However, it has two major problems: the price of the gamble and transparency. The price of the gamble comes from unfriendly user rules: a large house edge of 1% - 15%, money deposit/ withdraw fees and 2 - 3 days withdrawal delays. Besides that, there is no way of knowing what is happening inside the casino servers and how the mechanisms are programmed. It can be easily rigged. Players need to rely on trust in the casino which is not the best option in such a profit-driven industry.
p5
aVIn 2008, Bitcoin solved the gambling price problem. It offers instant money transactions without any fees, anonymity, a 0.01% - 2% house edge and more. Cryptocurrency gambling is on the rise with 890 million BTC wagered in 2016, market value that has grown by 37% from 2015.  Cryptocurrency gambling has become a choice for many. However, it still has not solved one major problem: transparency. Most casinos provide a method called a \u2018Fairness Check\u2019 to prove their transparency. However at this point, Fairness Check does not work and casinos still have the full power to cheat against their own players.
p6
aVUsing the power of the Ethereum smart contract, we are introducing the Ethereum-based Online Casino which offers ZERO edge for its players and 100% transparency.
p7
aVAbsolute transparency. The random number generator is based on an Ethereum Smart Contract which is completely public. That means that everyone can see everything that is going on inside the servers of the casino.
p8
aV0% house edge. Our casino will offer games that are solely based on skill and luck. If played perfectly, people will have a 0% edge gambling experience. If players, however, make mistakes, the casino will profit in the long run.
p9
aVFull anonymity. Cryptocurrency wallets are anonymous, and our casino will not require any log-ins or registrations, thereby providing absolute anonymity.
p10
aVInstant money deposits and withdraws. Instant and cost-effective cryptocurrency transfers will provide instant money deposits and withdraws for the customer, while regular casinos hold your money for 1 - 3 days before remitting it to you.
p11
aVEven with decentralized randomness generation and payout systems, Edgeless observes laws, rules and regulations of an online gambling. Once we launch a full version product, we will have a casino license which includes; certified RNG mechanism by legal authorities, strict terms and conditions, responsible gambling information, account registration as well as other needed requirements to fit into a legal framework. In this way, we support legal and responsible gambling.

aVIn the first phase, we will develop 0% house edge Blackjack and the "Edgeless Lounge". The Lounge will ensure a decentralised price pool which is backed by 40% of casino profits. People will have a chance to win it using our EDG tokens. Another part of investment will be allocated to the casino bankroll/bank so the casino can pay out wins for the first wave of visitors.

aVAt this phase, most of the funds will be allocated to security and hacker prevention plus increasing the size of Edgeless Casino\u2019s bankroll so that it can payout larger wins. An increased bankroll can take more visitors and wager larger bets. Learn more \uf105

VThe Token\u2122 Contract Wallet: secures users' assets and enforces user-set spending and security parameters.
p4
aVYour physical TokenCard\u2122: connects your Contract Wallet to a debit card network \u2014 enabling online payments, PoS transactions and ATM withdrawals, using ERC20 tokens in the Token\u2122 Contract Wallet.
p5
aVThe mobile Token App: neatly unifies the process, offering a clean, intuitive experience and empowering users to finally go bankless, wherever they are.
p6
aVTokenCard\u2122 introduces an underlying ERC20 token, TKN, holding a pro-rata claim on the TKN Asset Contract. This Asset Contract accrues a 1% licensing fee (enforced by smart contracts) on all TokenCard transactions. At any time, TKN holders can redeem their share of the underlying assets by 'cashing and burning' their TKN.
p7
aVLearn more about TokenCard\u2122 by reading our White Paper and get TKN by joining our Token Creation Event.
p8
aVThe Post Bank Era  The mobile Token App eliminates any need for a traditional bank account. You can manage your tokens, review spending activity, and make & request payments all through the App.
p9
aVWallet Access  With the Token App you can safely and easily interact with your Contract Wallet. Create innovative spending options based on different parameters and curate your security profile to fit your lifestyle.
p10
aVOn the Fly Information  Whenever a user swipes his card, a transaction entry will simultaneously appear in his Token App displaying business name, establishment type, amount spent (local fiat amount and token), and transaction location using Google Maps API.
p11
aVEnhancing Every Token  TokenCard allows you to spend ERC20 tokens at debit card terminals around the world. This is revolutionary: you can buy groceries in DGX, ETH, DAI or any other ERC20 token. You can even spend multiple tokens in a single transaction, and even autonomously maintain a desired portfolio allocation within your Contract Wallet while you do it.
p12
aVAlways in Control  You never have to deposit with us, ever. Your tokens are secured inside a contract wallet you control. Allowances to enable TokenCard payments are set by you and can be modified or even revoked at any time by you.
p13
aVNo Compromises  Traditionally, users are forced to make sacrifices in functionality to gain security, or security for functionality. With TokenCard there is no trade-off. You retain the security and control of a contract wallet while gaining the utility of a global payments network.
p14
aVExpanding the Ecosystem  The most exciting use-cases for TokenCard are within the markets being explored by other projects in the space. Actively integrating with these native Ethereum platforms gives TKN holders direct access to diversified markets while providing connections to a major payment rail.

aVTaaS is a tokenized closed-end fund designed to reduce the risks and technical barriers of investing in the blockchain space. Built on a profit-sharing smart contract, TaaS introduces an innovative Token-as-a-Service business model, allowing investors to subscribe to the fund\u2019s income stream. TaaS built an innovative Cryptographic Audit technology to become the first, truly transparent fund dedicated to cryptocurrencies and tokens.
p8
aVTaaS introduces an innovative business model that allows investors to capitalize on the rise of blockchain markets without dealing with the hurdles, risks and technical barriers associated with owning, transferring and trading cryptocurrencies and tokens. Open for investment exclusively during the Initial Coin Offering, TaaS is a last generation closed-end fund (CEF) that utilizes the Ethereum blockchain and Cryptographic Audit technology to offer full transparency to its investors. Unlike traditional closed-end funds that issue a fixed number of shares which are not redeemable from the fund, TaaS issues tokens built on a profit-sharing smart contract.
p9
aVThe smart contract allows token owners to collect 50% of quarterly profits. To grow the capital pool without attracting additional investment, 25% of profits will be reinvested back into the fund. This allows the Net Asset Value (NAV) of a token to increase over time, making TaaS the first blockchain token to have its value explicitly tied to the performance of a parent project. In its essence, by effectively eliminating entry barriers and allowing investors to safely subscribe to the fund\u2019s income flow, TaaS introduces a Token-as-a-Service (TaaS) business model.
p10
aVWhile smart contracts can safely guarantee honest payout distribution, they don\u2019t provide transparency when investing in non-Ethereum tokens. We built an in-house Cryptographic Audit (CA) technology to provide this transparency. CA is a set of monitoring tools that lets any member of the public, regardless of TaaS token ownership, to easily validate trading history and portfolio balances. Among other solutions, it includes Regular Blockchain Snapshots, Proof of Reserves and view-only API keys. Cryptographic Audit is built to set high security standards for money flow in blockchain projects. We see it as a significant milestone for future ICOs on their way of mainstream adoption.
p11
aVOur mission is to deliver long-lasting innovations to blockchain community, hence in additionally to running the fund, we are building Kepler, the first Bloomberg-like cryptocurrency portfolio management and analytics platform. Kepler will covering the entire spectrum of the investment process, from market research, due diligence and order management all the way to risk exposure and performance forecasting. Development expenses will be covered entirely by TaaS\u2019 profits. Kepler MVP is already in the making, with private beta release scheduled for Q3 2017.

CA is built to set high security standards for money flow in blockchain projects. We see it as a significant milestone for future ICOs on their way of mainstream adoption.
p13
aVHere is how we\u2019re going to achieve our transparency goals:
p14
aVWe will give preference to using exchanges that have Proof of Solvency (PoS) implemented; cold storage reserves can be audited, as in Poloniex and Kraken.
p15
aVFor each account that is going to be used for trading on the exchanges, we will create a view-only API key that will allow anyone to verify the balance and trade history of the account. We believe that this does not increase the security risk as it is already known that exchanges are managing large volumes of cryptocurrency and we have an account with every major exchange. TaaS will be hosting an audit page with a full list of API keys and aggregate account information, automatically pulled from the exchanges by our service. It will look similar to Tether implementation.
p16
aVFor all non-exchange accounts, such as cold storage addresses, that will be used for storage of our funds we will provide a proof of ownership: a transaction with a special marker in OP_RETURN (or similar feature, depending on a the blockchain protocol) will be sent from each account in order to verify that the account in question belongs to TaaS.
p17
aVWe will use TLSNotary or a similar solution to provide cryptographic proof of fiat currency reserves in our bank and exchange accounts. In short, this can be achieved by recording SSL signatures of online banking sessions.
p18
aVTo have proof that nobody mismanaged data between audits, a special smart contract will be developed to hold permanent daily snapshots of audit data. The contract will be supplied with a convenient contract explorer.

p16
aVExisting technologies in the blockchain space do not secure communications between nodes and are not well suited to withstand network-layer censorship. This potentially enables man-in-the-middle attacks against a network and increases the risk for transaction malleability attacks. Zen strives for hardened communications in the most adverse environments by encrypting all traffic traversing the wire.
p17
aVZen combines cutting-edge offensive security technologies in data exfiltration and sensor obfuscation to mask network activity. State of the art domain fronting enables direct access to the Zen network using encrypted HTTPS connections; all an observer sees is encrypted web traffic to high-reputation servers.
p18
aVIn non-domain-fronted environments, transport-layer obfuscation makes detection of traffic a very troublesome task. Traffic across the wire appears to be ambiguous in nature making Zen very difficult to censor.
p19
aVZen integrates zero-knowledge communications with external persistent datastores for infinite possibilities. To put it simply, Zen is an irrevocable publishing platform.

VXtraBYtes (XBY)
p2
(lp3
VThe initial and primary use of the XtraBYtes platform will be for decentralized shared storage. This will be an unique platform that will secure your data from anywhere in the world. The future of storage is not on a PC and it surely is not on your phone. XtraBYtes is the answer!!
p4
aV
aVProof of Signature is extremely resource friendly and achieves consensus through a network of trusted STaTiC nodes, rather than anonymous individual signature like other coins. With PoSign all STaTiC nodes sign the blocks and the end result of multiple signatures is the highest possible security.
p5
aVThe Virtual Chord Network is the UPPER layer of the XtraBYtes decentralized super system. This is something you cannot touch or see, the VCN is not affected by bandwidth or resources. The XtraBYtes VCN is a series of UNLIMITED and UNRESTRICTED canals where information is stored and transmitted by the the STaTiC node network.
p6
aVXBY is the latest innovation of blockchain technology, utilizing PoSign (Proof of Signature) consensus verification, along with a Virtual Chord Network which is driven by a series of STaTiC nodes and nonSTaTiC nodes. XBY is stronger, lighter, faster and more secure.
p7
aVXtraBYtes can be purchased through the cryptocurrency exchange C-CEX.
p8
aVFirst on tonights agenda is to disclose more information about STaTiC Nodes, as well as a little more vision of the future of XtraBYtes as a corporation:\u000a\u000aIf you have 1 STaTiC node, you will have 3 different wallets. This is for your security, system functionality and for your SHOCK rewards (more on that later) to be deposited.\u000a\u000aIf you have 2 STaTiC nodes, you will have 5 different wallets (as opposed to 6).\u000a\u000aIf you have 10 STaTiC nodes, you will have 21 different wallets.\u000a\u000aThis is how the system will be set up from this perspective because it only needs 1 spendable wallet for all nodes, but each node needs 2 wallets:\u000a\u000a1. Is for your deposit of 1 million XBY.\u000a2. Is for your STaTiC node.\u000a\u000aAfter registration of your STaTiC node, you will receive a special key for the STaTiC. Once registered, you can then completely remove the #1 wallet (with all your coins) from your computer. But first, you back up your wallet.dat and you get the private key from the wallet and you save that private key, along with your deposit address ON PAPER and you lock this in a safe. You will need this information to access these coins in the future, to either close the STaTiC and spend the coins or to SELL the STaTiC to someone else.\u000a\u000aSo, do NOT lose this information and DO NOT leave it on your hard drive. Remove it completely because it will not be required once you register the STaTiC on the network and leaving in online can result in virus or malware stealing your private keys, thus your money.\u000a\u000aWallet #2 will stay on your computer though. This is the STaTiC and it has ZERO coins in it... Now you are safe and the network is secure.\u000a\u000aOne of the key features of the configuration Borzalom has designed is that not only is the XtraBYtes network safe, there is ZERO financial gain for any hacker to bother trying to get into the system. There are no coins in any of the STaTiC wallets.\u000a\u000aOn top of this, in order to try to attack the system, the hacker would need to access the majority of the STaTiC node private keys (more on that at midnight GMT) and this is simply NOT possible.\u000a\u000aFor anyone setting up multiple STaTiC nodes, there will be some special configuration required in addition to the configurations we will help you with upon registration. These are essentially required to run multiple QT's in parallel, otherwise only 1 instance of any QT wallet is possible on each computer. Otherwise, it is better if you have 1 per computer and another option we are discussing as time passes is to set up your STaTiC remotely (at a hosting provider) and this will be a truly and HIGHLY decentralized way to do things. But, we will get to that later when everyone is earning profits from their STaTiC nodes.
p9
aVWe are going to give your STaTiC Rewards a cool name... We think SHOCK is pretty cool and we hope that future successes will leave you shocked each day when you are receiving your "hopefully" ever increasing rewards in the form of STaTiC SHOCKS!! ;) Anyone opposed to this cool name? Not likely... :))
p10
aVNow, here is some not so good news:\u000a\u000aSomeone mentioned that they hope the whitepaper will be available in 2 to 3 weeks... This is not possible, maybe in 2 to 3 months. However, we also see that we have many highly experienced people who are part of the community now and it is very possible there are some developers among us who will be ready to come on board and join forces as part of the CORE DEV TEAM. This can certainly move things forward much faster.\u000a\u000aThis is followed by some more good news:\u000a\u000aXtraBYtes is a destiny... the story behind this is truly amazing and it is totally REAL. As such, our intention is to create a corporation and we HAVE set our sites on being the #1 brand for DECENTRALIZED SHARED STORAGE SYSTEMS. With a name like XtraBYtes, half the challenge is already done... that is THE PREMIUM name for this market space in my opinion. Agreed??\u000a\u000aI mention this because we are developing a massive community and this is the long term goal. We have some VERY good ideas that we will present later that we feel EVERYONE will love and it will be the heart and soul of XtraBYtes.... and yes, that means YOU!! (there are some hints in this statement... wink wink).\u000a\u000aSo, get yourself some XBY and hopefully you can get enough for a STaTiC Node!
p11
aV
aVThe PoSign Mining is very easy to understand.\u000a\u000aEach client (STaTiC Node) sees the same transactions and therefore each block is equally visible by the entire network. The STaTiC Nodes job with regard to the consensus is to simply sign the blocks. If any STaTiC tries to sign a fake block, the other STaTiC's will blacklist it and continue signing the VALID blocks.\u000a\u000aFor example:\u000a\u000aLet's say there are 100 STaTiC Nodes online across the network and 1 tries to create a block that contains fake information (such as; fake transaction or bad blockhash etc...) This fake/bad block hash will be different than the other 99 hashes and therefore the other 99 clients (STaTiC Nodes) will send a warn/repair RPC message to the "bad" client. If the "bad" STaTiC Node repairs the block then the hash will become the same as the other 99. If it doesn't repair it and instead tries to resend over and over, the other nodes will eventually blacklist the STaTiC.\u000a\u000aAll other nodes (non STaTiC nodes) will see the last block that signed and how many STaTiCs accepted.\u000a\u000aIn comparison; Bitcoin and all other coins have only one untrusted, randomly selected node that signs and creates the block. With XBY, each block is created and signed by all the currently ONLINE STaTiC Nodes.\u000a\u000aWith XtraBYtes, there is no POW or POS mining to sign and verify the blocks. As we said, each online STaTiC signs and this is where you start to see the power of PoSign... Because, this means there are more signatures and more signatures = more security. Nobody can know all private keys from the STaTiC Nodes and therefore it is impossible to create fake STaTiC signed blocks.\u000a\u000aAt this point, we have ONLY 1 STaTiC node controlling XBY and the network is fast and secure...\u000a\u000aAfter more STaTiCs have been registered on the network, XBY will be better than ALL other coins in the crypto world.\u000a\u000aAt this point, nobody really understands what is really happening here... We are developing THE COIN ;) This is the LATEST INNOVATION in BLOCKCHAIN technolgy and our man Borzalom is the Genius Mastermind who thought of it.\u000a\u000aSo, to summarize:\u000a\u000aIf Bitcoin security is 100% (with untrusted nodes signing the blocks) How much more powerful is XBY when it is also (100% + the use of trusted nodes) * the number of STaTiC Nodes? Like I said... he was blowing my mind when he was explaining all this to me a few nights ago.\u000a\u000aCongratulations to all of you who are already with XtraBYtes... You are way ahead of the people who will be coming on board soon.... VERY SOON...\u000a\u000aI encourage you to get the word out to your closest friends and family... We honestly have no idea where this can go on the SATOSHI scales when word gets out about this...

VAt ChronoBank.io, we are challenging the status quo and bringing an alternative to traditional financial systems.
p4
aVThis alternative is a new generation of time-based currencies utilising the latest developments in blockchain technology.
p5
aVDespite soaring interest in distributed ledger technology, there are currently very few blockchain apps poised for mainstream market adoption.
p6
aVChronoBank.io has been designed by a consortium of professionals with over 100 years of combined recruitment experience, in consultation with experts who can create the software to leverage blockchain technology to solve real-world business problems.
p7
aVSpecifically, we want to create a revolution in short-term recruitment within key professions.
p8
aVOur goal is to make a difference to the way people find work and are rewarded for their labour \u2013 doing so within a decentralised framework and without the involvement of traditional financial institutions.
p9
aVLabour is abundant enough for everyone to have access to it, yet scarce enough to be valuable. It is the most tradeable resource in the real economy.
p10
aVLH tokens will tokenise this resource. Because they are backed by real labour, they are absolutely inflation-proof and have next to zero volatility \u2013 in comparison to bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.
p11
aVThis solution is far more sustainable than any of the fiat-pegged or backed coins that currently exist in the crypto market. LH tokens will be hyper-liquid and accessible 24/7 via the LH debit card.
p12
aVLH tokens will act as a substitute for payments in fiat currencies and will enable people to be rewarded for their work \u2013 without cryptocurrency\u2019s signature volatility risk.
p13
aVWe have taken great care to design the system for ease of use, to make sure that actual labour time and the LH token can be exchanged efficiently for each other. While timebanking in its simplest form uses a standard exchange rate for time, each ChronoBank.io participant will have reputation assigned to them, to enable them to access remuneration appropriate to their skill level.
p14
aVThe better the individual\u2019s reputation based on previous work, the higher the price they will be able to command for an hour\u2019s work. Initial reputation will be set based on the individual\u2019s experience within the partner company from stage one of the project.
p15
aVFor those who have not participated in the system in any previous capacity, a nominal average reputation will be assigned.
p16
aVEvery care is taken to incentivise the user to increase their reputation and maintain it at the highest level.

(lp3
VVeriCoin and Verium is the first dual blockchain protocol technology that pairs a digital currency with a digital reserve. This means faster transactions, more security and solves the digital currency scalability puzzle.
p4
aV
aVCurrent digital currencies face an impossible task of trying to be both a fast currency and a secure store of value. VeriCoin and Verium together solve this problem with the groundbreaking dual blockchain system called Binary-Chain. Binary-Chain, secures and accelerates transactions by leveraging complementary protocol technologies (PoST [Proof-of-Stake-Time] and PoWT [Proof-of-Work-Time]), into a cutting edge blockchain ecosystem. This results in:
p5
aVThe chains are self-sustaining and with no single central point of failure making them truly unique.\u000aTogether they create a more secure, faster and safer financial system.
p6
aVVeriCoin transactions are currently 10x faster than Bitcoin and will be even faster when paired with Verium. Transaction fees are minuscule.
p7
aVMiners earn Verium through Proof-of-Work-Time (PoWT) with higher fees and slower block times.
p8
aVVerium can be mined by anyone with a PC or laptop. Verium is ASIC and GPU resistant allowing anyone to participate. This creates a more decentralized network and improved security over centralized mining schemes.
p9
aVVeriCoin and Verium were designed to be compatible with shared addresses and private keys. Upon future release of Artis (see Roadmap), you\u2019ll be able to easily exchange your Verium & VeriCoin across chains without the need for a 3rd party.
p10
aVA purely digital currency that runs on its own protocol PoST (Proof-of-Stake-Time), which is unique to VeriCoin.
p11
aVVeriCoin (Ticker: VRC) transactions are currently 10 times faster than Bitcoin, nearly instant and via Verium will become even faster. Unlike Bitcoin, you gain interest like a savings account by simply leaving your digital wallet running on your computer. This process is known as staking, another form of digital minting of new coins, and helps validate transactions on the VeriCoin network. VeriCoin allows anyone in the world with an internet connection the ability to transfer and receive funds in a matter of seconds. People who are not able to, or do not have access to a bank account, will now have access to an already established and flourishing financial network. VeriCoin is backed by the technology that will change the world.

aVA purely digital commodity which runs on it\u2019s own unique protocol PoWT (Proof of Work Time).\u000aVerium (Ticker: VRM) was created to be an innovative, independent store of value asset, in addition to supporting the VeriCoin blockchain. Verium solves the blockchain scaling issue by introducing a new variable block-time paradigm that speeds up as mining power increases. This allows Verium to automatically scale, enhance transaction speed and capacity, while ensuring security at any level of mining. Through Verium\u2019s auxiliary mining protocol, Verium will also process VeriCoin blocks. This process will speed up VeriCoin\u2019s block-time to 30 seconds or faster. This enables VeriCoin\u2019s network to provide an efficient and scalable ecosystem for consumer transactions well beyond current standards. Verium is accessible to anyone with a PC or laptop in three easy steps. Download, install and click to mine. It\u2019s that easy!
